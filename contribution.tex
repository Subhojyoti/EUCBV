In this paper we propose the Efficient UCB Variance (hence referred to as EUCBV) algorithm for the stochastic MAB setting. EUCBV by virtue of it taking into account the empirical variance of the arms performs significantly better than the existing algorithms in the stochastic MAB setting. EUCBV also  outperforms UCBV \cite{audibert2009exploration} which takes into account empirical variance but is less powerful than EUCBV because of the usage of exploration regulatory factor and arm elimination parameter by EUCBV. Theoretically we prove that for $T\geq K^{2.7}$ our algorithm is order optimal and enjoys a worst case gap-independent regret bound of $O\left( \sqrt{KT} \right)$ same as that of MOSS and OCUCB and better than UCBV, UCB1 and UCB-Improved. Also the gap-dependent regret bound of EUCBV is better than UCB1, UCB-Improved and MOSS and is poorer than OCUCB. But EUCBV gap-dependent bound matches OCUCB in the worst case scenario when all the gaps are equal. An illustrative table containing the bounds is provided in Table \ref{tab:comp-bds}.

	Empirically we show that EUCBV owing to its estimating the variance of the arms performs significantly better MOSS, OUCUB and UCB-Improved. Also EUCBV is the first arm-elimination algorithm that takes into account the variance estimates of the arm for minimizing cumulative regret and thereby answers an open question raised by \citet{auer2010ucb}. Also it is first algorithm that follows the same proof technique of UCB-Improved and achieves a gap-independent regret bound of $O\left( \sqrt{KT} \right)$ thereby closing the gap of UCB-Improved \cite{auer2010ucb} which achieved a gap-independent regret bound of $O\left( \sqrt{KT\log K} \right)$.
