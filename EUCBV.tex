\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for the stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. Our proposed Efficient Clustered UCB method, referred to as EClusUCB partitions the arms into clusters and then follows the UCB-Improved strategy with aggressive exploration factors to eliminate sub-optimal arms, as well as entire clusters. Through a theoretical analysis, we establish that EClusUCB achieves a better gap-dependent regret upper bound than UCB-Improved~\cite{auer2010ucb} and MOSS~\cite{audibert2009minimax} algorithms. Further, numerical experiments on test-cases with small gaps between optimal and sub-optimal mean rewards show that EClusUCB results in lower cumulative regret than several popular UCB variants as well as MOSS, OCUCB~\cite{lattimore2015optimally}, Thompson sampling and Bayes-UCB\cite{kaufmann2012bayesian}. 
%We also present another algorithm called Adaptive Clustered UCB or AClusUCB which is intended to look at the effect of using more traditional approaches, like hierarchical clustering, for the grouping of arms.
