\frametitle{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> We proposed the EUCBV algorithm for the SMAB setting which uses variance and mean estimation along with arm elimination to find the optimal arm.
\item<2-> Theoretically, EUCBV achieves an order-optimal regret guarantees, but further studies are required to reduce the constants.
\item<3-> A more detailed analysis of the non-uniform arm selection and parameter selection is also required for EUCBV.
\item<4-> \textbf{Acknowledgement: } We thank Google India for granting us with a generous travel grant to present our work in AAAI 2018.
