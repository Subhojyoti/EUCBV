In this paper, we studied the EUCBV algorithm which takes into account the empirical variance of the arms and employs aggressive exploration parameters to eliminate sub-optimal arms. Our theoretical analysis conclusively established that EUCBV enjoys an order-optimal gap-independent regret bound of $O\left(\sqrt{KT}\right)$. Empirically we showed that EUCBV performs superbly across diverse experimental settings and outperforms most of the bandit algorithms in stochastic  MAB setup. Our experiments showed that EUCBV is extremely stable for larger horizons and performs superbly  across different types of distributions. One future work is to remove the constraint of $T\geq K^{2.4}$ required for EUCBV to reach the order optimal regret bound. Another future direction is to come up with an anytime version of EUCBV.
